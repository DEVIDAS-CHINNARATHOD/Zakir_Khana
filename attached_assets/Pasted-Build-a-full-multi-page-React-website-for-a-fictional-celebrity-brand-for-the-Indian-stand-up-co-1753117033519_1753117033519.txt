## 🧩 **Core Tech Requirements**

✅ Use **Vite** or **Create React App** for setup  
✅ Use **React Router v6** for routing  
✅ Use **Tailwind CSS** or CSS Modules for styling  
✅ Use **React Hooks** only (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)  
✅ Use **@react-three/fiber** and **@react-three/drei** for Three.js integration  
✅ Use the **Intersection Observer API** for scroll-triggered fade-in animations  
✅ Use CSS transitions & transforms for hover effects and slide-ups  
✅ Add `scroll-behavior: smooth` for smooth scrolling

## 🧩 **Header & Footer**

- Create a reusable `Header` with a placeholder logo and nav links to all main pages.  
- Create a reusable `Footer` with site nav, social icons (Instagram, YouTube, X), and a copyright line.

---

## ⚡ **Home Page Hero Section**

- Full-screen hero section with a `<Canvas>` background.
- Add a simple **3D particle field or starfield** that moves gently with mouse movement.
- Overlay big heading: **“Zakir Khan — Sakht Launda Official”** with a CTA button like “Shop Merch.”
- Position the text above the `<Canvas>` using absolute or grid layout.
- Make the hero responsive and smooth.

---

## 🧩 **Smooth Scroll + Scroll Animations**

- Implement **Intersection Observer** to reveal sections with fade-in and slide-up when they enter the viewport.
- Use a reusable `useInView` hook.
- Apply animations to sections across **Home**, **Shop**, **About**, **Shows**.

---

## 🛍️ **Shop Page**

- Grid of product cards (use mock products: 2 T-shirts, 1 hoodie, 1 mug).
- On hover, add subtle **3D tilt or scale** using CSS transform or React Three Fiber plane.
- Each card links to `/product/:id`.

---

## 🧩 **Product Detail Page**

- Use **React Router** dynamic route `/product/:id`.
- Add a `<Canvas>` with a placeholder 3D model:
  - Example: A rotating `Box` or `Sphere` for now.
  - Add `OrbitControls` so the user can drag to rotate.
  - Auto-rotate slowly when idle.
- Below 3D, show product title, price, Add to Cart button, and dummy description.
- Add fallback static image if WebGL is not supported.

---

## 🎤 **Shows Page**

- Grid or timeline of upcoming shows.
- Each card: city, date, venue, Buy Tickets button.
- On hover, subtle depth or slide animation.

---

## 🧩 **Show Detail Page**

- Dynamic route `/show/:id`.
- Show details: city, venue, date, time.
- Add a subtle **3D particle or confetti background** in `<Canvas>`.
- Add a live countdown timer.
- CTA button for Buy Tickets.

---

## 🛒 **Cart Page**

- Show added products with quantity adjusters.
- Include a link to proceed to `/checkout`.

## 👤 **About Page**

- Optional: Add a floating 3D sign or simple particles.

---

## 🖱️ **Site-wide Microinteractions**

- Add a **custom cursor** that’s a circle or dot following the mouse.
- On hover over buttons, expand or glow.
- Use CSS and React state.

---

## 📌 **Performance**

- Keep all 3D elements lightweight.
- Use placeholder primitives for now.
- Add static fallbacks for mobile if needed.
- Keep animations smooth and don’t block user input.

---

## ✅ **Deliverable**

One complete **multi-page React site**:
- All pages working and linked.
- All smooth scroll, scroll reveal, hover, and 3D features working.
- Fully responsive for mobile and desktop.
- Clear placeholder text and images so it can be connected to a real backend later.

---

**Remember:**  
Use **React Hooks**, **React Router**, **Tailwind or CSS Modules**, **Intersection Observer**, and **React Three Fiber**.  
No external animation libraries like GSAP — use native CSS and Three.js only.

✅ **This is the complete spec — build exactly as described.**
