 1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Alignment & Aesthetics

Review all images on every page.

Ensure they are properly centered, cropped, and aligned within their containers.

Use consistent aspect ratios for products and hero images ‚Äî no stretching or odd crops.

Add enough whitespace and padding to make the site feel premium and uncluttered.

Use subtle overlays or gradient masks if needed to make text over images readable.

For Zakir‚Äôs motivational vibe, use clean fonts, bold headings, and simple color blocks (black/white with warm yellow/orange accents).

üñºÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ Better Images for Each Section

Home hero: High-resolution wide portrait with subtle fade or scale-in on load.

Shop/Product: Products on neutral or transparent backgrounds.

Shows: Stage shots or event photos.

About: Professional photo + motivational tagline.

Fan Gallery: Group crowd shots or fan photos with consistent style.

‚úÖ 3Ô∏è‚É£ 3D Elements Using Three.js

Use @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei for real 3D:

Keep the hero background with 3D particle field or starfield.

For Product Detail, add a real rotating 3D object ‚Äî a basic T-shirt mockup, mug, or placeholder primitive.

Add subtle background 3D accents on the About or Shows page (example: floating soft shapes or confetti in the corner).

Keep all 3D models lightweight for fast load.

Add fallback for mobile if needed.

üñ±Ô∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ Mouse Animation ‚Äî Limited & Classy

Do NOT hijack the mouse site-wide.

Add custom cursor or hover animations only in specific places:

Product cards: tilt or lift on hover.

Buttons: cursor expands or glows on hover.

Hero CTA: cursor effect when hovering over big call-to-action.

Keep normal cursor for text and general browsing.

‚ö° 5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance & Theme

Use dark mode as default or toggle, with a warm motivational vibe.

Optimize all images (.webp if possible).

Use CSS transitions and simple Three.js animations to keep FPS smooth.

Make sure the site feels premium on desktop and mobile.

‚úÖ Final check:

Every page should look clean and polished.

Images aligned and balanced.

3D effects are subtle but add depth.

Cursor interactions feel intentional and don‚Äôt distract.

This should match Zakir Khan‚Äôs clean, motivational, ‚ÄòSakht Launda‚Äô brand. Please adjust accordingly and share a preview!‚Äù**
